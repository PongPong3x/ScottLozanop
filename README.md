# Art Market

Should allow only creator to log in and upload content to her marketplace page. 

The artist can place an item for sale, the ownership of the item will be transferred from the creator to the marketplace.

When a user purchases an item, the purchase price will be transferred from the buyer to the seller (the artist in this case should be the only one who can create) and the item will be transferred from the marketplace to the buyer.

The marketplace owner will be able to set a listing fee. This fee will be taken from the seller and transferred to the contract owner upon completion of any sale, enabling the owner of the marketplace to earn recurring revenue from any sale transacted in the marketplace.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
